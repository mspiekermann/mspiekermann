My favorite code quote, "<span id="k">... the architecture supports it!</span>" <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! I am Markus! <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->
<p>
I am with Huawei Technologies working as a Lead Architect for Data Ecosystem in the Munich Reseach Center (MRC). Currently, I am mainly 
working on building Dataspaces, i.e. building infrastructures and components for data exchange between companies and solving related 
challenges such as interoperability, scalability, and trust.

Enable data economy and building trust in cross-organizational data sharing will require technical solutions for attaching policies to data assets 
and implement suitable protocols for advertising data, negotiate policies and control the transfer. This is why I am strongly engaged in Eclipse 
Foundation's Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) project, which provides a free and open-source framework for organizations that want to building
production-ready dataspace technologies. Do you want to learn more about it?

What else to say? Before my time at Huawei, I was leading the department 'Data Business' at the <a href="https://www.isst.fraunhofer.de/en.html">
Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering</a> in Dortmund, Germany. <br/>
I have my Master's degree in IT Management and am currently doing my PhD at TU Dortmund University on the topic of 
Industrial Data Space Architectures: Economic and Engineering Design Options.

<p>
I love to try different technologies, to combine them and to discuss and develop new solutions. Ideas for this often come while I am running, 
which I also love and do several times a week. Fits well together!
