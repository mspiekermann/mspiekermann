Hey There! I am Markus Spiekermann. <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->
<p>
I am leading the department Data Business at the Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering in Dortmund, Germany. <br/>
I have my Master's degree in IT Management and am currently doing my PhD at TU Dortmund University on the topic of Industrial Data Space Architectures: Economic and Engineering Design Options.
</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>
I love to try different technologies, to combine them and to discuss and develop new solutions. Ideas for this often come while I am running, which I also love and do several times a week. Fits well together!

<p> Currently, I am mainly working on building data spaces, i.e. building infrastructures and components for data exchange between companies and solving related challenges such as interoperability, scalability, and trust.
Here I lead the Eclipse Foundation's Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) project, which provides a free and open-source framework for the development of data spaces and integration of technologies and trust frameworks. Do you want to learn more about it? <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-edc"> Here you go</a>.
